Changing Locale in Ember Application
Overview
The provided JavaScript snippet offers a convenient way to dynamically change the locale of your Ember application. This functionality is especially useful for applications that need to support multiple languages and offer users the ability to switch languages on the fly.

How It Works
The changeLocale function searches for the Ember application instance in the global window context. Once it finds the Ember application, it attempts to access the intl service. The intl service is responsible for internationalization in Ember applications. The function then changes the application's current locale to the new locale specified by the caller. If successful, it logs a message indicating that the locale has been changed. If it cannot find the intl service or the Ember application instance, it logs an error message.

Usage
Ensure Intl Service is Available: Before using this snippet, ensure that your Ember application has the intl service set up. This typically involves adding an internationalization addon to your project, such as ember-intl.

Include the Snippet: Copy the provided JavaScript snippet into a file and include it in your project. Alternatively, you can include the snippet directly in your HTML template or a specific JavaScript file that is loaded with your application.

Invoke changeLocale: To change the application's locale, simply call changeLocale(newLocale) from anywhere in your application, where newLocale is the locale identifier (e.g., "en-US", "fr-FR").

Example:

javascript
Copy code
changeLocale('en-US'); // Changes the locale to English (US)
Global Access: The changeLocale function is attached to the window object, making it accessible globally throughout your application.

Troubleshooting
Intl Service Not Found: If you encounter an error stating that the Intl service is not found, make sure that the ember-intl addon is properly installed and configured in your Ember application.

Ember Application Instance Not Found: This error may occur if the script is executed before the Ember application has been fully initialized. Ensure that your script runs after the Ember application is available in the window context.

Conclusion
This script provides a straightforward method for changing the locale of an Ember application dynamically. It leverages the Ember application's architecture and the intl service to achieve seamless language switching, enhancing the user experience in multilingual applications.
